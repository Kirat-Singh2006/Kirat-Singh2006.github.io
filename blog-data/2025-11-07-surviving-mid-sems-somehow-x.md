so its been a while hasn't it? since i got here and posted a blog but yeah as the title suggests I've been busy surviving my mid semester exams(for any one wondering yeah i did pretty well ;]). so as for anything new I've made? yeah i made this little reconnaissance tool named ReconX it was a fun mini project to make after the exams i learnt quite a lot about networking and stuff so the cybersecurity journey is going well,I've been looking into where I fit and all that and right now the most compelling option to me sounds like the GRC line of this field more specifically the lines of Cybersecurity GRC Specialist or GRC consultant it aligns more with my passion and my talents and yeah it seems like something I'd enjoy doing. I've also been trying to be more social? i guess you can call it that?? but yeah overall im thinking of really improving my life moving forward and come out of this shell I've made around me to make up for my lack of confidence and be more of a person I wanna be.\
so ending salutations now ig? idk im never good at these things so yeah I know this blog got a little more personal and less about tech stuff so yeah until next time \
