Soooo it’s been a while since my last post, but honestly nothing crazy happened… except a tiny life update:

I didn’t go down the GRC route after all.

Yeah yeah, cry about it, I know it was the obvious path, the stable one, the “smart” one… but it’s *my* career, man. Let me do what I wanna do.

And right now?

SOC is what speaks to me.

It’s interesting, it’s active, it’s hands-on, and it’s not boring policy work. So that’s the route I’m choosing.

Anyway, I also wrapped up my practical end-term exams, so that’s a win. Finals don’t start until the 15th of December, so don’t expect many updates until then… unless something interesting happens (unlikely, but who knows).\

Oh, and one more thing I’m finally planning to get my cybersecurity certification after my end-semester exams. Since I picked **Information Security** as my elective too, everything’s lining up perfectly.

That’s all for now.

K… BYE
