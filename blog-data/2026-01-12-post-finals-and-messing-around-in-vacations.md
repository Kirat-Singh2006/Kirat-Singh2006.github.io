So, it’s been a while.



No, I didn’t forget my password or disappear. I just took a proper break after finals. I spent time with family, let my brain cool down a bit, and tried not to burn myself out.



Interestingly, I didn’t end up doing much directly related to cybersecurity during this break. Instead, I followed pure curiosity for once and went down a completely different rabbit hole: computer vision.



That led me to experimenting with hand tracking, where I built a simple air painter, and eventually to a slightly more security-flavored idea: a small system that locks my PC the moment it detects a phone behind me in view of the camera.



None of this was meant to be production-ready or portfolio material. It was just me messing around, learning something new, and enjoying the process without pressure. Honestly, it was a lot of fun.



Overall, the break did what it was supposed to do. It reset my head and reminded me why I like building things in the first place.



Here’s to 2026 being better than 2025, or at least a little less chaotic.

Cheers.\
