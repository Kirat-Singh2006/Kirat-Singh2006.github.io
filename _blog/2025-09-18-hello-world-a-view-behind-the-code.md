Yo, welcome!

I’m Kirat Singh(I also go by Wrench if you prefer that), and yeah… this is my first blog post. I’m a BCA student who can’t sit still when it comes to building stuff — sometimes it’s coding a dumb-but-fun 3D ASCII donut, other times it’s spinning up a lightweight SIEM just to see how far I can push network monitoring.

This blog is basically my dumping ground for experiments, wins, and the occasional “why did I even try this?” project. Expect posts about things like:

\    •    The pain (and fun) of real-time object detection with YOLOv8

\    •    How I hacked together a SIEM and what it taught me about security

\    •    Random Python tricks — like surviving multithreading without losing your sanity

I don’t promise everything here will be groundbreaking, but I do promise it’ll be real. If you’re into coding, cybersecurity, or just want to watch someone break stuff until it works, stick around  should be fun.
