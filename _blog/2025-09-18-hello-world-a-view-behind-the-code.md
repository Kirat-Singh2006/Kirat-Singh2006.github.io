Hello, and welcome! I'm Kirat Singh, and this is my first blog post. As a BCA student, I'm constantly learning and building, and this space is where I'll be sharing some of that journey. From coding a 3D ASCII donut just for fun to building a Python script to quietly monitor network logs, I'm passionate about the entire process of turning an idea into a working piece of software. In the coming weeks, I plan to write about the projects you see on my portfolio, sharing what I learned while building them and how I tackled the challenges. You can expect deep dives into topics like: \* The challenges of real-time object detection with \*\*YOLOv8\*\* \* How I built a \*\*Lightweight SIEM Solution\*\* and what I learned about network security * Tips and tricks for multi-threaded programming in Python Thank you for visiting my site. I hope you'll find my posts useful and insightful!
