                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I'm Kirat Singh — a second-year BCA student who builds things that shouldn't work… but do. Whether it's a 3D ASCII donut spinning in a terminal, a Java MP3 player that vibes with the playlist in my head, or a Python script quietly monitoring logs like a detective, I'm always chasing that sweet spot between "how does this even work?" and "this is actually useful."</p>
                <p>I like my code like I like my music — layered, unexpected, and a little bit psychedelic. My projects mix the retro and the modern: old-school C console games, AI object detection, and interfaces that feel like they were designed on a rainy afternoon with too much coffee.</p>
                <p>Right now, I'm sharpening my skills in Python, C, Java, and JavaScript, while exploring cybersecurity, computer vision, and anything else that feels like uncharted territory. I'm here to learn, break, fix, and build — sometimes in that order.</p>

                        <h2>Hello to a new look =]</h2>
                        <div class="blog-post-meta">November 8, 2025 • 2 min read</div>
                        
                        <p>So after like 6 or 7 brutal hours of redesigning the website we finally have a new look gone is the old bubblegum aesthetic i tried a very neon techy look just didn't scream me so i ditched it and made this i like its minimal it fits well and hey whose photo is that? oh yeah that's me ;]</p>

                        <p>The design journey was interesting. I started with bright, neon colors thinking "yeah, this is super techy and cool" but then realized it just felt... off. Too much. Not <em>me</em>.</p>

                        <p>So I stripped it all back. Went minimal. Clean lines, simple colors, just the essentials. And you know what? It feels right. Sometimes less really is more.</p>

                        <p>Also added my photo because why not? If this is my corner of the web, might as well own it.</p>

                        <p>Hope you like the new look. I'm pretty happy with how it turned out.</p>

                        <h2>surviving mid-sems somehow...X]</h2>
                        <div class="blog-post-meta">November 8, 2025 • 4 min read</div>
                        
                        <p>so its been a while hasn't it? since i got here and posted a blog but yeah as the title suggests I've been busy surviving my mid semester exams(for any one wondering yeah i did pretty well ;]).</p>

                        <h3>ReconX - A New Project</h3>
                        <p>So as for anything new I've made? yeah i made this little reconnaissance tool named ReconX it was a fun mini project to make after the exams i learnt quite a lot about networking and stuff so the cybersecurity journey is going well.</p>

                        <p>Building ReconX taught me a ton about network protocols, packet analysis, and how information gathering actually works in the real world. It's one thing to read about reconnaissance in textbooks, but actually implementing it? That's where the real learning happens.</p>

                        <h3>Finding My Path in Cybersecurity</h3>
                        <p>I've been looking into where I fit in the cybersecurity world and all that and right now the most compelling option to me sounds like the GRC line of this field more specifically the lines of Cybersecurity GRC Specialist or GRC consultant it aligns more with my passion and my talents and yeah it seems like something I'd enjoy doing.</p>

                        <p>GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) combines technical knowledge with strategy and communication, which honestly sounds perfect for me. It's not just about breaking things or finding vulnerabilities — it's about understanding the bigger picture, helping organizations make informed decisions, and building sustainable security programs.</p>

                        <h3>Personal Growth Stuff</h3>
                        <p>I've also been trying to be more social? i guess you can call it that?? but yeah overall im thinking of really improving my life moving forward and come out of this shell I've made around me to make up for my lack of confidence and be more of a person I wanna be.</p>

                        <p>So ending salutations now ig? idk im never good at these things so yeah I know this blog got a little more personal and less about tech stuff so yeah until next time :}</p>

                        <h2>Hello World! welcome to my corner of the web</h2>
                        <div class="blog-post-meta">September 18, 2024 • 3 min read</div>
                        
                        <p>Yo, welcome!</p>

                        <p>I'm Kirat Singh (I also go by Wrench if you prefer that), and yeah… this is my first blog post. I'm a BCA student who can't sit still when it comes to building stuff — sometimes it's coding a dumb-but-fun 3D ASCII donut, other times it's spinning up a lightweight SIEM just to see how far I can push network monitoring.</p>

                        <h3>What to Expect Here</h3>
                        <p>This blog is basically my dumping ground for experiments, wins, and the occasional "why did I even try this?" project. Expect posts about things like:</p>

                        <ul style="margin-left: 2rem; color: #999; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                            <li>The pain (and fun) of real-time object detection with YOLOv8</li>
                            <li>How I hacked together a SIEM and what it taught me about security</li>
                            <li>Random Python tricks — like surviving multithreading without losing your sanity</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>No Promises, Just Real</h3>
                        <p>I don't promise everything here will be groundbreaking, but I do promise it'll be real. If you're into coding, cybersecurity, or just want to watch someone break stuff until it works, stick around should be fun.</p>
